## 💡 Project Idea

**KeyScope** is a web platform where users can type in any event, person, or issue, and the system automatically collects relevant news articles and visualizes the extracted keywords.  
By clicking on keywords, users can explore various related news articles and sources, gaining insight into key trends and broader contexts in a complex media landscape.

## 🎯 Project Overview (Objective)

A hallmark of the modern information landscape is the **"filter bubble"** phenomenon caused by algorithmic personalization, which limits users to certain viewpoints and interpretations.  
This biased exposure prevents balanced understanding and may even lead to social conflict.

KeyScope addresses this issue by:

- Presenting **alternative contexts or opposing perspectives** on the same issue.
- Helping users move beyond a **single narrative** to explore multifaceted information.
- Offering a **broader and deeper understanding** through keyword-based exploration and summarization.

Through **NLP-based keyword extraction**, **news APIs**, and a **visualized UI**, KeyScope acts as a **fast and insightful news discovery tool** in an age of information overload.
